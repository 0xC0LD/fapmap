=====[ FAPMAP DOWNLOADER / WEBPAGE SCANNER (webgrab.exe) / VIDEO DOWNLOADER (youtube-dl.exe) ]=====
|	
|	- Use webgrab.exe to download embeded files from websites... (4chan(most board sites)/xvideos/xnxx/xhamster/...)
|	- Use youtube-dl.exe to download metadata files (videos) from websites (youtube/redtube/pornhub/...)
|	
|	DOWNLOAD - embeded files from websites (images/gifs/...):

|		2. put webgrab.exe in the fapmap folder (the same folder with the fapmap.exe)
|	
|	DOWNLOAD - (metadata) videos:

=====[ SCRIPTS ]=====
|	
|	You can make your own script files.
|	Just add "fapmap_mod" in the name of the file (ex. [youtube-dl fapmap_mod.exe])
|	and when you open the file fapmap will prompt you with a window allowing
|	you to input arguments (%1, %2, %3, ...) that will be passed onto the script/exe/program/...
|	
|	I have already made some scripts... just extract the "scripts.rar" file and a folder (Scripts) should appear in the "Main Folder"
|	with all the scripts (Main Folder\Scripts\*)...
|	

=====[ ICONS FOR URL BOARD ]=====
|	
|	After installing fapmap extract the favicons.rar (use: Right-Click -> Extract Here) ...
|	icons should appear in the ".\data\favicons" folder
|	
|	ADD YOUR OWN ICONS:
|		1. to add your own icons you'll have to view the HTML of the website (on some browsers, use CTRL+U)
|		2. than find (on some browsers, use CTRL+F) the favicon.ico file 
|		3. locate the link of the .ico/.png/... (image) file
|		4. download the file
|		5. put it in the ".\data\favicons" folder with the name of the website
