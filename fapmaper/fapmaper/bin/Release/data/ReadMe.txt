=====[ Programs you should have ]=====
| Put: ffmpeg.exe, youtube-dl.exe, webgrab.exe, fscan.exe, CrashHandler.exe ... 
| in the same folder as fapmap.exe for everything to work

=====[ Scripts ]=====
| You can make your own script files.
| Just add "fapmap_mod" in the name of the file (ex. "youtube-dl [fapmap_mod].exe")
| When you open the file fapmap will prompt you with a window allowing you to input command line arguments (%1, %2, %3, ...)
| that will be passed onto the script/exe/program/...
| 
| I have already made some scripts... just extract the "scripts.zip" file
| and a (scripts) folder should appear in the "Main Folder"
| with all the scripts (Main Folder\scripts\*)...

=====[ Icons for URL(s) ]=====
| After installing fapmap extract the favicons.zip (use: Right-Click -> Extract Here) ...
| icons should appear in the ".\data\favicons" folder
| 
| ADD YOUR OWN ICONS:
|  1. to add your own icons you'll have to view the HTML of the website (use CTRL+U)
|  2. then find (use CTRL+F) the 'favicon' file 
|  3. locate the link of the .ico/.png/... (image) file
|  4. download the file
|  5. put it in the ".\data\favicons" folder with the name of the website



... will add more stuff in the future...
