## Programs in this repository:
- fapmaper ("fapmaper" is the "installation" program... all it really does is copy the contents from the "data" folder to the given location, then it hides the destination folder):
- Lock (LockedFolder) (password GUI) ("Lock" should be the entry point of your gallery. The program is supposed to be accessed through a shortcut on your desktop. When opened, the user should be prompted with a password GUI (the password is stored in the data/password.dll file)):
- fapmap ("fapmap" is the file browser, link/URL bookmarker):
    - custom video player GUI (uses WMP binaries)
    - custom image/gif viewer GUI
    - a file downloader (+ GUI for webgrab)
    - a file scanner (GUI for fscan)
